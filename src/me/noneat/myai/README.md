Please be aware that this source code may be filled with bad solutions, bad performance and other bad styling mistakes. 
I will have a look at all these things in some weeks.

A learning AI that can talk to you and answer your questions.

(was: Chappie, now: Soupe)

# What is Soupe?
Soupe is a custom AI written in Java. It uses a SQLite database to get and store answers and questions.
Soupe will be just a little bit similar to Siri or Cortana; Soupe will be your friend - like a tamagotchi, just better!
The goal is that Soupe will be able to learn from the user's input.
