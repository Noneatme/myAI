# myAI / Mappie
A learning AI that can talk to you and answer your questions.


# What is Mappie?
Mappie is a custom AI written in Java. It uses a SQLite database to get and store procedual answers and questions.
Mappie will be just a little bit similar to Siri or Cortana; Mappie will be your friend - like a tamagotchi, just better!
The goal is that Mappie will be able to learn from the user's input. We are currently researching the alogithms to get the best out of the system.


# Can I test it?
Not yet, the only thing you can do is open the included project solution in the Intellij IDEA IDE. Once this AI is working correctly, we will upload a testable release soon.
Please note that there is not a human brain or consciousness in this AI implemented. Our current time knowledge doesn't allow us to use this method in this AI.

# What can I do?
Currently, you can support us by giving us suggestions or pull requests. Once we implemented the learning system into the AI, you will be able to train the AI and give him sentences.
We will make a PSA if we are ready. But it will take some months. Maybe even years.
